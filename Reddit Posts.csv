800m School Record + Improvements,1,skmaya,trackandfield,https://www.reddit.com/r/trackandfield/comments/skmaya/800m_school_record_improvements/,2,"Tldr; two seniors are racing to break the school record in the 800m, I’d like to be the guy but need some help on improving my time. I don’t have a coach who’s willing to learn about the sport and help us improve so I’ve been planning out workouts and such for the team & have currently hit a plateau.
———————————
Hello everyone, I’m a 400/800 (sometimes mile) middle distance runner and I’m running out of time. My teammate and I have been going at it for the past four years in the 800m. The school record is 2:00.51 and it’s basically a race to see who’s going to be the first guy at our school to break the 2 min barrier.

He’s a 2:04 runner while I’m a 2:07 runner. I’ve noticed that the gap between our times has decreased by a lot ever since COVID (he’s been around 1:28 for 600m this year (PR of 1:24 sophomore year)) while I went from 1:34 (sophomore year) to 1:32 now.

My question is, what sort of workouts would I need to reel him in and break this barrier? 

Coach? Unfortunately our great one has retired and we’ve been left with someone who doesn’t coach us at all (for the entirety of indoor and XC I’ve been providing the team workouts from what I’ve learned through YouTubers such as Sage Canaday). So I can’t ask my coach for anything because he gives bs responses and time and time again has shown us that he’s unwilling to learn more about the sport and such. (This part was more of a rant haha)

Some things you may want to know about me (not sure):
Weekly Mileage: 10-15miles/week because the snow here has been screwing us over (upwards of 35-40mpw during the summer and XC)
PRs: 400 - 55.78, 600 - 1:32.49, 800 - 2:07, 1000 - 2:56, 1600 - 5:15, 5K - 18:35",1644003691

I was pricing out a trip to Eugene for World Athletics Championships 2022, and holy shit it is expensive. Was looking at tickets here:

&#x200B;

Day 10 evening tickets are $400 minimum?? Is this what people normally pay for these events? Are they limiting ticket sales because of covid? I just think it's absolutely absurd that it would cost multiple thousands of dollars to watch a couple days of this.

 I am a Senior in high school, and will probably run D3 for a small college. I run the 1600m, 3200m, and 800m (Order of priority). I am going into my second year of track, and want to take things a little bit more seriously this time around. Last year I ran in my trainers and did well, and only this last year did I get spikes for XC. I run sub 5 mile and 18:30 5k if that helps. I would like for me to be able to take them to college to run in. If I don't buy spikes, I would use my Saucony Killkey XC 8’s.

Cons: Might be too long distance for me (3k+)
Nike Air Zoom Victory ~ 180 - 4.6oz
    Pros: Carbon plate, heard they are super fast and.  super comfortable
Cons: Expensive, not durable 
New Balance MD-X ~ 180 - 4.4oz

Cons: Non-removable spikes (durability)
Hoka CIELO X MD ~ 160 4.5oz

I really liked it and let’s say I was above average at most events. I Started training more serious from the age of 15. 

I really liked the long jump, high jump and sprinting. My long distance running was pretty good too, but I really hated it.

At the age of 16 I ran 100m in 11.89 seconds and 400m in 52.46 seconds.
(weight around 65kg/144 lbs, length 180cm/5’9ft)

But then I discovered weightlifting. At first I could combine my hobby’s but eventually I skipped my track and field sessions for weightlifting. I never did track and field again since, even though I really missed it.

About 3 years later. I am 19 years old now. I gained about 20kg/45lbs naturally. I maintained a healty bodyfat (about 12-14% I guess) I still have an athletic fysique, but gained muscle.  I feel like returning to track and field and sprint again. But I am afraid my fysique now is not optimal and could slow me down.(current weight 86kg/190lbs, 183cm/6’0 ft) 

I could cut down some weight to 81-83kg. 

Maybe people in this Reddit could share some experiences about weight lifting combined with sprinting? Or if being more muscular could be a positive thing in sprinting? 

 I am really curious if I could maintain my current fysique while also improve my old sprinting records. Please feel free to share your thoughts/questions!",1643643310

I'm 21M and was interested in getting into Track and Field, specifically into Sprinting.

I have to admit I was the kind of kid who lost sport tournaments in school the first round to chill with his friends afterwards (the tournaments you had to attend), so beyond me going for runs as workout, I unfortunately have no experience with running.

However, due to COVID restrictions in my country, I'm not allowed to attend sports courses indoors, which as far as I was able to read basically includes all teams in my area atm.

Without having the drill and insight of a coach training me, what possibility is there for me to get going? Obviously, I just start running and try to follow the FAQ, but is there anything that I as a beginner should especially be prepared for when I train alone?

And should I start running daily, or more 3-4 times a week?",1643631277

Watching a video from Latif Thomas the other day he mentioned doing workouts before fixing form can be detrimental, or at least not beneficial. So my question for you all is what have you found best for changing form from being backside heavy, to more front side? Alot of the kids I'm getting are basically used to ""running fast"" and not sprinting. So I have to retrain almost all of them. 

Also would it be worth it to get a freelap system? I thought about purchasing one and using the credit to purchase Latif's complete sprints program.

Subscriptions and Paywalls are necessary for content,3,sgds4r,trackandfield,https://www.reddit.com/r/trackandfield/comments/sgds4r/subscriptions_and_paywalls_are_necessary_for/,6,"Had a brief discussion with someone about the merits of subscription and paywall for track and field content. That person does not seem to understand that to produce videos and articles we want to watch and read, people have to be paid and nobody works for free.

There are three main channels on YouTube that I follow to keep up with XC and Track. FloTrack, MileSplit, and Sweat Elite. I follow a lot of other smaller channels like Athlete Special, L&L, and Gwen Jorgenson. If you're in the middle-distance and distance world, they're great to follow.

Content producers like FlotTrack, MileSplit, and Sweat Elite travel to record workouts and races. FloTrack does podcasting and only Mississippi's MileSplit has a podcast (Spotify search results). All of this is very expensive to produce. Travel, camera equipment, audio software, computers, replacing equipment that breaks, time spent editing video and written content, maintaining servers. All of this costs money. Subsriptions and paywalls are the best way for us to help pay the people who get us the content we want.

If you don't believe me, you can follow this link to a Sweat Elite video with the founder Matt Fox. He explains his plans for Sweat Elite to start generating more revenue to produce higher quality content starting about 6:30 into the video. This is just economics 101. To build and grow a market, you need financial support. The sooner the younger athletes learn and accept this as reality, the better the content will be over time.

To start, the most important thing is finding a college that fits you. Put your academics and own self growth above competing at a University. If you broke your leg the first week on campus, would you still be happy with your choice? Things to consider when looking at the mass amount of colleges:

⁃ In-State vs Out of State

⁃ Do you want to live in a big city or small town?

⁃ Major University vs Small School

⁃ Private vs Public

⁃ Admissions Standards

⁃ Cost of Tuition 

⁃ Financial Aid packages offered.

⁃ Majors/Departments (Do they offer what you want to study?)

⁃ Alumni Network

You can find all of this information for schools at websites like [www.PrincetonReview.com.](http://www.princetonreview.com./) In addition to the items listed above, it also includes acceptance rates, breakdown of GPA, 25-75th percentile ACT/SAT, Cost of tuition, average financial aid package, etc. It’s never too early to start reviewing what schools interest you. If you’re traveling you may want to stop and visit a prospective schools as you’re passing through.

**Understanding Collegiate Athletics:** 

The primary association of collegiate sports is the NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Association). There are three tiers of competition within this organization:

Division 1: 

• Largest universities and the overall highest level of collegiate athletics. 

• The majority of state and large universities are Division 1.

• Schools are allowed to give out a total of 12.6 athletic scholarships for men’s XC/Track & Field and 18.0 for women XC/Track & Field. 

• Majority of schools have a Track & Field Program

• Note: Schools in the Ivy League (Harvard, Brown, etc) do NOT offer any athletic scholarship.

• Example D1 Schools: Florida, Florida State, Georgia, Clemson, Texas, Harvard, South Carolina, Tennessee, Baylor, Stanford, 

Division 2: 

• Smaller schools and generally less known

• Overall less competitive than Division 1

• Schools are allowed to give out a total of 12.6 athletic scholarships for men’s XC/Track & Field and 12.6 athletic scholarship for women’s XC/Track & Field. 

• Usually have smaller rosters than D1 thus easier to receive scholarship.

• Includes mostly private schools so tuition may be higher.

• Many do not have a Track & Field Program.

Division 3:

• Small schools and generally private

• No athletic scholarships 

• D3 schools can be just as competitive as Division 2 despite no athletic scholarship. This is due to several more prestigious schools being D3 such as Johns Hopkins, MIT, NYU, and Carnegie Mellon. Athletes may use their ability to assist them gaining admission into the school.

• On average have larger team size than D2

• Example Schools: Johns Hopkins, Haverford, Geneseo Street, Calvin, St. Lawrence, Wisconsin Platteville, Wisconsin Stevens Point, Dickinson, Washington-St. Louis, New York University, MIT, Carnegie Mellon, 

&#x200B;

There are also some other organizations that offer athletics. This includes:

NAIA (National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics): 

• Smaller 4-year colleges

• Less strict requirements to compete.

• There are equally talented players in the NAIA and NCAA D2 schools

NJCAA (Junior College):

• Junior/2-year colleges

• Small Team sizes

• Can offer athletic scholarship.

• Very loose requirements to compete. For example, any student may compete as long as they have not previously competed in intercollegiate competition. Technically, even parents could compete for these schools if they attended them.

• Generally used as a stepping stone. Athletes will often attend Junior College (JUCO) to improve grades before attending a 4-year university. It’s is a good way to save a lot of money by getting your Associates Degree (AA) before receiving your Bachelors at a 4-year University.

**Scholarship Information** 

Only 7.0% for male high school XC athletes and 8.6% for female high school XC athletes will compete at the varsity collegiate level. Only 1.8% of male XC athletes and 2.5% of female XC athletes will compete at the highest level (NCAA Division 1). While the odds may seem tough, it’s certainly not impossible if it’s something you wish to do as there are many different levels.

People tend to think all athletic scholarships as only “full ride” (full scholarship) or “walk on” (no athletic scholarship). In Cross Country/Track & Field, D1/D2 schools are limited as to how much athletic scholarship they can give out while D3 offers no athletic scholarships. D1, for example, only has 12.6 male scholarships and 18.0 female scholarships to field both their XC and Track & Field rosters. If you consider this is generally broken up into 4 years, there is usually only about 3-4 full scholarships available for each genders incoming freshman class. This is to fund an entire Cross Country/Track & Field team which can be as many as 50-60 athletes. In short, a full athletic scholarship is extremely rare in XC/Track & Field and scholarships are generally broken up into many partial scholarships (15%, 20% etc).

Instead of looking towards a rare athletic full ride, you need to consider the entire financial package. After all, you may still end up with a very good portion of your college being paid. Things outside of athletic scholarship to consider are:

⁃ Academic Aid

⁃ Grants

⁃ Need based Aid

⁃ Outside Scholarships

⁃ Florida Bright Futures (or similar in-state programs)

⁃ In-State vs Out of State Tuition (i.e: UF tuition is $6,381 per year for Florida residents while it’s $28,658 for out-of-state students)

⁃ Public vs Private (Private schools can get VERY expensive but often offer better academic aid packages to bring the cost down).

So overall, athletic aid is just a portion of your financial consideration. If you were to get a partial scholarship you may receive other grants, academic scholarships, and need based scholarships that covers the majority of your tuition.

**Standards for Competing in College:**

There is a wide variety of athletes that compete across all divisions in college. Here is a very general breakdown of the average athlete in each division. Note: Coaches will not always consider your XC time because courses and conditions can be so different. Just because you run a specific time on one occasion doesn’t mean you meet a specific programs requirement. Similarly, if you don’t run one of the specified times below, it doesn’t automatically disqualify you from every program in that division. I have also included a breakdown of track mid-distance to distance times. The track times listed are aggressive/faster as they are the range for an athletic scholarship requirement for each division. 

Once again, if you don’t have those exact times, it by no means disqualifies you as there is a wide variety of teams/programs in each division with different standards and depends on whether or not you are looking towards athletic scholarship. The best thing you can do is contact a schools coach to see exactly what they are looking for.

Here is a very broad breakdown of the type fo athletes schools in each division is looking from, as seen on: [http://www.athleticscholarships.net/trackandfieldscholarships.html:](http://www.athleticscholarships.net/trackandfieldscholarships.html:)

**How & When To Begin The Recruiting Process:** 

Division 1 and Division 2 coaches are not permitted to call or email you prior to the start of your Junior Year. 

Division 3 coaches can contact you as a junior in high school.

The recruiting process is generally straight forward in cross country (and track & field) compared to some sports. For example, in many team sports, you are expected to attend specific tournaments, send game film of yourself, attend camps, etc. The college coaches need to see you play (often several times) in order to determine if you are the right fit for their team. In addition to this, there are many variables such as the quality of the opponent, quality of your own team, etc. It can be a challenge to set yourself apart - especially at the highest level.

For cross country and track & field it is quite a bit simpler. You can let your times and/or finishes at the state meet do the talking for you. Track times for distance events, as well as XC times, can be sent to the coach and they will have a solid understanding of your ability. In fact, many college teams will even list specific time standards they are looking for.

Generally, it falls on you as an athlete to make the first move. The ideal scenario is as follows:

• Create a list of 5-10 schools (or more) that interest you. 

• Visit the cross country and/or track & field section of their athletic website

• See if they have time standards to make their team. If not, look through their roster, last years’ results to try get an idea of the general range they are looking for. If a team is comprised of all athletes who ran a 16:00 5k or faster in high school, there’s no point wasting your time if you’ve only run 18:30 for 5k.

• Go to PrincetonReview.com to see if you are a good fit for the school academically, financially, etc. 

• If you align with a school academically, athletically, financially, then fill out the Cross Country or Track & Field Recruiting questionnaire. Most schools will have this listed, but if there is no questionnaire then email the coach directly. Write a personalized email - no generic templates.

• Get certified by the NCAA Eligibility Center ([https://web3.ncaa.org/ecwr3/):](https://web3.ncaa.org/ecwr3/):) REQUIRED for official visits or to sign a National letter of intent.

If your XC/Track & Field times, GPA, SAT/ACT Scores interest the coach, they may call you and begin the recruiting process. Recruiting services are a rip-off for cross country and a waste of time. Everything can and should be done by yourself. I can also help in any way possible, although I often just look through the teams website and school info on Princeton review to create a breakdown like below (something you can certainly do by yourself as well):

University of South Florida

⁃ Enrollment: 48,793 

⁃ 47% acceptance rate

⁃ 25th - 75th percentile SAT Reading: 530-620

⁃ 25th - 75th percentile SAT Math: 540-630

⁃ 25th - 75th percentile SAT Writing: 510-600 

⁃ 25th - 75th percentile ACT: 24-28 

⁃ In-State Tuition - $6,336/Year

⁃ On Campus Room & Board: $9,700

⁃ NCAA Division 1

⁃ Wide range of athletes, but girls HS 5k PRs generally range from 20:30-21:00. 

⁃ You can see their 2016 results here: [http://www.gousfbulls.com/documents/2017/6/24//4978008.pdf?id=15578](http://www.gousfbulls.com/documents/2017/6/24//4978008.pdf?id=15578)

⁃ Recruiting Questionnaire: [https://college.jumpforward.com/questionnaire.aspx?IID=1625&SPORTID=58](https://college.jumpforward.com/questionnaire.aspx?IID=1625&SPORTID=58)

⁃ Does have a track & field team

You may receive letters in the mail. This is often a mailing blast sent to hundreds of athletes. You still need to fill out the questionnaire or email the coach to continue the recruiting process.

**Continuing Communication:**

When contacting coaches, they want to hear from YOU - not your parents and not your coaches. Ultimately, you are the one that will be attending the school so you should be the one communicating with them. If they want to talk with your parents or coaches, they will certainly find a way to do so.

When making the initial contact with the coach, you have to realize they may be hearing from hundreds of athletes. Keep the email concise and list your PRs, State Meet Finishes, and GPA/Test Scores. Coaches don't have time to read a long-winded email about your work ethic and being vice president of the key club. Consider your email like a resume: keep it short and quickly detail your accomplishments within a paragraph of two.

If a coach calls you on the phone, they have a certain degree of interest in you. Do not be afraid to ask questions! They will often dictate the conversations but may ask questions about your training (how many miles you run), upcoming races, what you’re looking for in a school, etc. Sometimes athletes get nervous or the phone call doesn’t go as planned. If you have spoken to a coach, it doesn’t hurt to reach out to them and reiterate your interest, ask any questions you may have forgotten, and continue the conversation. Remember, they will be contacting MANY athletes.

If you have no interest in the school whatsoever, let the coach know. Maybe the school is out of state while you’re certain you want to stay in-state. It may be a different division than you want to compete in. Whatever the reason, if you’re certain you don’t want to attend their school there is no point wasting both of your time. Let them know. They won't take it personally and will simply move onto the next athlete.

After several phone calls, a coach may invite you to attend the school on an “official visit”.  This is an all expenses paid visit to the school where they will show you the campus, introduce you to the team, coaches, training staff, academic advisors, etc. In short, it’s an extended campus visit that the school pays for. You are only permitted to take 5 official visits.

Alternatively, they may ask you to come visit “unofficially”. This may apply if you’re racing at the school during a weekend and they just want to meet you face to face.

During the entire recruiting process and even now, it’s important you are careful what you post on social media. Just as you are considering the school as a complete package, the coach is considering you in the same way. Coaches will often look through your social media accounts to see if you are the type of athlete and person that’s right for their program. Posting ridiculous things on your Twitter, Instagram, etc could cost you scholarship money or even a spot on a team you are interested in.

Between NCAA, NAIA, and NJCAA, there are over 1,200 men’s XC programs and over 1,300 women’s XC program. If competing in college is something you aspire to do, work on getting your times down and find the program that fits you best. Above all, find the school that suits you and where you can see yourself growing academically and as a person.

**Quotes from college coaches themselves** (from athleticscholarships.com):

As stated by Florida State’s head coach Bob Braman:

“It's very important for high school athletes to understand that our sport is very objective and that times, distances, etc. can be measured against other athletes all over the world.  The reality is major college programs like ours will not recruit athletes with “untapped potential”.  We want the best of the best and then we’ll separate them based on coaching , competition, etc.

Always look on the universities’ athletic webpage and see if they list scholarship standards.  Even if they don’t be sure to only contact those that fit your talents. Always send a personalized e-mail to either the head coach or event coach.  In the e-mail you should include best performances / marks and SAT/ACT/GPA information.

Biggest misconception is that we’re like Football.  Track and Field is limited to 12.6 scholarships for men and 18 scholarships for women.  With 19 events plus cross country to cover that means that full scholarships are extremely rare”

The head coach, Brenden Rickert, from D1 school Fairfield University (in Connecticut), states:

“Know the school you're applying to - don't write a generic email to every coach. Look at the times and/or performances of athletes currently on the roster to see how you compare. If you're way off, chances are you will not be on the team.

Don't use a recruiting service - times and performances don't lie so we do not need to see a video of you running. Do not give us times that cannot be found on a legitimate website, we will assume they are wrong.  Fairfield University

Update 1-2 times per week. There's dozens of you and only a couple coaches, so the more you update the more you're on our radar. Prepare and ask questions- we want you to make the best decision for you. Let the coach know if you're no longer interested in the school.

Enjoy the process, it's a whirlwind but if you do it right, you'll have some amazing experiences that you'll remember for the rest of your life.”

I'm feeling like my body doesn't want to run anymore.,19,sf14fv,CrossCountry,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrossCountry/comments/sf14fv/im_feeling_like_my_body_doesnt_want_to_run_anymore/,3,"I'm writing this post out of frustration and hopelessness about running has been feeling lately.

I feel like I improved throughout high school in running and was best my senior year (especially in track) without changing my training that much. However my freshman year of college, I PR'd in the 5k, so technically I was still improving. My last effort I was happy with was a 2 mile track time trial in November. After that, I feel like everything went downhill (or uphill should I say?). I took a week off to prepare for indoor track training and then when I came back to running, I was injured, so I had to take about a month of. I cross trained for a week and a half, but basically did nothing for 2 weeks.

I've been attempting to run since then. Luckily, I'm pain free in that injury location. It's just my legs feel very heavy, when running and climbing stairs. I've probably put on 5 pounds from where I'd like to be (I'm 5'3"" and 133), but I don't know if that's it, because I PR'd weighing 131. I have no energy on my runs unless I go at a 9:30-10:00/mi pace and I've had to drop out of every single workout so far which has been discouraging to say the least.

Last winter I was running half marathons at 7:40/mi paces with massive negative splits, running a 10k in 45 mins and just feeling great, low heart rate, etc. Now it's like I go out for a 4 mile run in the 8:50 range and have to stop 4 times and just feel like I'm dragging myself through the run.

My PR in the mile is 5:43 (spring 2021) and now I feel like getting under 7 right now would be a struggle. My 5k PR is 20:4x (was actually during a 6k race) but I doubt I could go much faster than 23 right now.

My coach suggested getting tested for anemia, but I don't think that's it. I think I'm just not getting enough sleep, got out of shape, and just can't come back. In the back of my mind, I'm worried that my body has changed and that I'll never get back in shape at all, which I know might be a possibility. I want to be a lifelong runner, but I'd still love to compete in college, but now things are looking bleak.

Before I used to barely run over the winter/summer at all and come back and be in fine shape for cross country. Even just last spring, I basically went right from being injured to PRing in the mile. I'm just losing patience.

Does anyone have any insight on what could have happened? Is it just natural for me to be slowing down as I get older? Thanks.",1643404992

A Reminder For Your Track Season,39,s3wr86,CrossCountry,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrossCountry/comments/s3wr86/a_reminder_for_your_track_season/,3,"Hey buddy,

Something I have seen frequently both in-person and on /r/crosscountry are posts about a loss of fitness after taking an extended break after cross country. 

This reminds me of a friend I had who started going on a diet to try and lose 100lbs. 

My friend would stick to their diet for two days, then take five days off. After doing this for two months, he was frustrated that he wasn't losing weight as fast or consistently at all - in fact his weight didn't change!

The posts and conversations I've had recently remind me of this friend. Without consistent, focused effort, it can be near impossible to improve on a weekly, monthly, and yearly basis. 

The sooner you can maintain a running, strengthening, and mental practice routine, the sooner your running will improve. Now, this can be hard at first - working together with your teammates can help. 

To finish, imagine if you’re a freshman or younger and plan on running throughout high school.

How much faster would your senior year self be if you could maintain consistent running, strengthening, and mental training 45-48 weeks per year?

Right now he can't even run a mile without stopping. We did a walk/run for 2 miles and it was about 22 minutes. So I know he is not currently in shape for cross country. Do you think it would be unreasonable (or embarrassing, which he is worried about) to go out for cross country?

Now another runner with the same times emails the coach, but does not use Strava, so the coach assumes his mileage is less. The coach chooses this second person to make his team. Now this may be very oversimplified, but does stuff like this happen? Can it be bad to use Strava when trying to be recruited by colleges? I appreciate any input.",1640817644

Slowest D1 schools by pace,33,rcp748,CrossCountry,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrossCountry/comments/rcp748/slowest_d1_schools_by_pace/,13,"I've been working on a spreadsheet that shows the slowest D1 schools by conference. For the men, I set a standard that 25:00 for 8k would be considered slow. For the women I felt like I couldn't set a hard standard b/c some conferences had their women race 6k and others 5k but still tried to maintain some consistency with who and what I picked. In some instances I put the entire conference into a column b/c they didn't meet the standard I set for fast. Some teams probably shouldn't be on this list b/c of how they ran their conference meet i.e. both Furman teams scored 15 at their conference meet which tells me they weren't racing very hard that day due to their conference being very weak.

Some conferences are just weak but that is likely due to their school's being more academically focused and that is ok. That's how school should be. Some schools may not recruit with the full amount of scholarships they're allowed to recruit with. This list was made for those of you with D1 aspirations so you can see where you might fit based on current times and paces and leverage your abilities to get good financial aid packages. Someone running 5:20 for a 5k isn't going to get money to run at NAU but could get money to run at Northern Colorado. D1 isn't the end all be all of collegiate running. D2 and D3 are valid options depending on your needs and desires.

So, if it’s too cold to run outside, what can I do inside that’ll help me with achieving better pacing/endurance/5k times. Also, I don’t own a treadmill.",1639000543

Has anyone ever run through this?,29,rank5g,CrossCountry,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrossCountry/comments/rank5g/has_anyone_ever_run_through_this/,7,"Hi,

So after XC we were on a 2-week break and since I remembered from last year how slow I was speed-wise, I did a few exercises that were apparently supposed to help with speed or something, but it was probably too much at once and hurt my knees.

So we started running in the last week and my knees have hurt. I rested over the weekend, but there was still a little pain today. I went to a doctor and they said it is an inflamed area below my knee where apparently (I don't remember exactly lol) two part of the bone/growth plate have created a gap which is naturally because I'm growing, but these exercises put some stress on it so it hurts when I run. They said it should get better- a week of rest could make it go away faster.

Has anyone been through anything like this? Is running through it OK?",1638841569

Running Lane Madness,49,r8y0bg,CrossCountry,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrossCountry/comments/r8y0bg/running_lane_madness/,10,"79 boys under 15 including the FOUR fastest times ever recorded and 20 girls under 17 including the second fastest time ever. Running Lane is basically a speed track you go to to get a (gigantic) PR. Lot of grumpy old guys will tell you Cross is not about time, just about winning and comparing times across different courses is stupid and misleading. But that didn’t stop a LOT of runners from streaming into Huntsville from all across the country to try and see how fast they could go. Of course a lot of that was because NXN was cancelled. But running for time seems to be becoming more of a thing now compared to just winning on a hard course. So what do you think? Do you think its good for the sport or bad for the sport? All I know is its entertaining to watch. Like watching an NBA Allstar game rather than a regular game. Yeah theres no defense so the scoring is ridiculous but wow what a show...",1638648686
