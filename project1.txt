Datasets to be used, with source URLs so we can take a look, and a brief description of the datasets

Why do you want to use this data? What do you wish to explore? We don't expect this to be a final answer, but at least show directional thinking.


Data Science Question:
How do various factors lead to success in Cross Country, Indoor Track, and Outdoor Track in the NCAA?

Dataset Description:

1. United States Track and Field and Cross Country Coaches Association Ranking Data
https://www.ustfccca.org/

Using web scraping via various URL paths, we collected championship data for the last 10 years for cross country, indoor track, and outdoor track. One notable variable is the change in ranking since the previous week. Here we can analyze which teams performed better in championships based on a variety of factors gatherered below.

Note: to see some of the specific cross country datasets, reference the links below:

2. World Weather Online Historical Weather API
https://www.worldweatheronline.com/developer/api/docs/historical-weather-api.aspx

After cross-referencing the dates and locations of the NCAA XC Championships from https://www.ustfccca.org/meets-results/meet-history?series=3367, we used this weather API to get a full scope of the weather at the site of the championship based on date and zipCode. Combining this data with the previous data will hopefully provide some trends in which teams performed better in various types of weather.

3. Reddit API
https://www.reddit.com/r/trackandfield/
https://www.reddit.com/r/CrossCountry/

Using the Reddit API, we collected 100 posts from the subreddit "Track and Field" and 100 posts from the subreddit "Cross Country". These are trendy, or "hot" posts, which we will use to analyze and assess the public's general feeling and reaction towards the sport and what some of the most talked about factors are. 
The text data was structured and formatted within a dataframe, with the 2 main columns "title" and "body" containing the text content of the posts.

4. Topographical API
https://portal.opentopography.org/datasets
https://portal.opentopography.org/usgsDataset?dsid=USGS_LPC_FL_LeonCo_2018_LAS_2019

Using the topograpical API we were able to download elevation data at a location of a known cross country course. The data in this repository is a sample of that data as the full dataset was too large to upload. The data using latitude and longitude to mark elevations determined by lidar technology. There are many differentl locations that we have access to with known cross country courses and we plan to use this data to compare different courses and performances.
