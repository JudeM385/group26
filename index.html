<h1>Success Factors in NCAA D1 Cross Country</h1>
<h2>ANLY 503: Mid-Point Summary</h2>
<h3>Authors: Matt Harding, Scott Johnson, Jude Moukarzel, Matt Young</h3>
<h4>Date: 10 April 2022</h4>
<br>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Running is a type of activity widely seen as a form of endurance training in order to improve one’s
cardiovascular health. Just like any activity, there are those who do it for recreational purposes, and others,
such as athletes, who do it with a more competitive spirit.
Cross Country is a sport that has grown in popularity over the years. Each year, runners of all ages
compete at various levels with the goal of outperforming one another. Some of the world’s best runners
perform and compete at the collegiate level at various colleges, such as BYU, Northern Arizona, Colorado,
New Mexico, Oregon and Arkansas.
Some collegiate teams are more successful than others, so we propose building our visualizations
around the different factors affecting success, such as location, weather, topography, and individual/team
attributes, which would enable users to better understand what exactly makes success in this sport.

<h2>Data Descriptions and Data Pre-Processing</h2>
<p>
Using web scraping via various URL paths, we collected championship data for the last 10 years for
cross country. One notable variable is the change in ranking since the previous week, where we can analyze
which teams performed better in championships based on a variety of factors gathered below.

After cross-referencing the dates and locations of the NCAA XC Championships from USTFCCCA,
we used this weather API to get a full scope of the weather at the site of the championship based on date and
zipCode. Merging this data with the championship data will hopefully provide some trends in which teams
performed better in various types of weather.

Using the topographical API, we were able to download elevation data at a location of a known cross
country course. The data in this repository is a sample of that data as the full dataset was too large to upload.
The data using latitude and longitude to mark elevations determined by lidar technology. There are many
different locations that we have access to with known cross country courses and we plan to use this data to
compare different courses and performances.

We plan to use this data to create visualizations that show the easier and more difficult portions of
courses and give insight into where runners may be able to take advantage of places on the course.

We collected text data using the Reddit API where we gathered 200 posts considered trendy or “hot”
from popular subreddits "Track and Field" and "Cross Country" . The text data was structured within a data
frame, with the 2 main columns "title" and "body" containing the text content of the posts. 
We plan on vectorizing the text data within each post (title and body) in order to build a word cloud and/or a
term frequency histogram as our visualization, which would hopefully shed some light on what some of the
most talked about factors are, and whether that impacts success in the sport.

In addition, we would possibly be able to identify schools that are noted in the text data and note what word(s)
is/are most associated with that school in the reddit data (word association visualization).

<h2>Usage Scenario & Tasks</h2>
<p>
Carter is an East Coast cross country coach for an up-and-coming program in the NCAA. He anticipates that
his team will be able to qualify for the NCAA championships in Stillwater in 2022, but he does not know
exactly the best way to train his athletes for the upcoming season. He wants to be able to explore a dataset in
order to compare the effect of various factors on cross country success in the NCAA and identify the most
relevant variables in order to adequately prepare and predict how his team will perform. When Carter logs into
his DirectAthletics app, he will see an overview of the variables that affect cross country performance. He can
filter out variables and see which particular variables impact performance the most. He might notice that a
school’s altitude is a strong predictor of the success of the team. He hypothesizes that if his athletes spend the
summer training in a city at a relatively high altitude, they will perform better at the following NCAA XC
Championships.
