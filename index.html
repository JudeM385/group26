<h1>Success Factors in NCAA D1 Cross Country</h1>
<h2>ANLY 503: Mid-Point Summary</h2>
<h3>Authors: Matt Harding, Scott Johnson, Jude Moukarzel, Matt Young</h3>
<h4>Date: 10 April 2022</h4>
<br>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Running is a type of activity widely seen as a form of endurance training in order to improve one’s
cardiovascular health. Just like any activity, there are those who do it for recreational purposes, and others,
such as athletes, who do it with a more competitive spirit.
Cross Country is a sport that has grown in popularity over the years. Each year, runners of all ages
compete at various levels with the goal of outperforming one another. Some of the world’s best runners
perform and compete at the collegiate level at various colleges, such as BYU, Northern Arizona, Colorado,
New Mexico, Oregon and Arkansas.
Some collegiate teams are more successful than others, so we propose building our visualizations
around the different factors affecting success, such as location, weather, topography, and individual/team
attributes, which would enable users to better understand what exactly makes success in this sport.
</p>

<h2>Data Descriptions and Data Pre-Processing</h2>
<p>
Using web scraping via various URL paths, we collected championship data for the last 10 years for
cross country. One notable variable is the change in ranking since the previous week, where we can analyze
which teams performed better in championships based on a variety of factors gathered below.

After cross-referencing the dates and locations of the NCAA XC Championships from USTFCCCA,
we used this weather API to get a full scope of the weather at the site of the championship based on date and
zipCode. Merging this data with the championship data will hopefully provide some trends in which teams
performed better in various types of weather.

Using the topographical API, we were able to download elevation data at a location of a known cross
country course. The data in this repository is a sample of that data as the full dataset was too large to upload.
The data using latitude and longitude to mark elevations determined by lidar technology. There are many
different locations that we have access to with known cross country courses and we plan to use this data to
compare different courses and performances.

We plan to use this data to create visualizations that show the easier and more difficult portions of
courses and give insight into where runners may be able to take advantage of places on the course.

We collected text data using the Reddit API where we gathered 200 posts considered trendy or “hot”
from popular subreddits "Track and Field" and "Cross Country" . The text data was structured within a data
frame, with the 2 main columns "title" and "body" containing the text content of the posts. 
We plan on vectorizing the text data within each post (title and body) in order to build a word cloud and/or a
term frequency histogram as our visualization, which would hopefully shed some light on what some of the
most talked about factors are, and whether that impacts success in the sport.

In addition, we would possibly be able to identify schools that are noted in the text data and note what word(s)
is/are most associated with that school in the reddit data (word association visualization).

<h2>Usage Scenario & Tasks</h2>
<p>
Carter is an East Coast cross country coach for an up-and-coming program in the NCAA. He anticipates that
his team will be able to qualify for the NCAA championships in Stillwater in 2022, but he does not know
exactly the best way to train his athletes for the upcoming season. He wants to be able to explore a dataset in
order to compare the effect of various factors on cross country success in the NCAA and identify the most
relevant variables in order to adequately prepare and predict how his team will perform. When Carter logs into
his DirectAthletics app, he will see an overview of the variables that affect cross country performance. He can
filter out variables and see which particular variables impact performance the most. He might notice that a
school’s altitude is a strong predictor of the success of the team. He hypothesizes that if his athletes spend the
summer training in a city at a relatively high altitude, they will perform better at the following NCAA XC
Championships.

<h3>Course Map Vizualization</h3>
One of the variables with the highest variance in cross country is the topography of the course. This is because races are run on courses that are not altered to be flat surfaces like tracks are. To be continued...

<h3>Investigation of Race Day Weather Conditions on Team Performance</h3>

<p>
As has been previously discussed, there are a plethora of variables and considerations that go into a successful Cross Country Team performance. 
Cross Country teams will spend months and years training and preparing for “The Big Dance” that is the National Cross Country meet in November. 
Even so, there is one variable that can never be truly prepared for: the weather on race day. 
The variable of weather conditions is uncontrollable by all teams and its effects are unbiased – with every athlete experiencing the same conditions. 
Because of this unique uncontrollable and unbiased nature, an investigation into how national caliber teams performed across various weather conditions was catalyzed to help determine what teams competed to their potential even in the harshest of weather conditions.
<br>
The following two visualization depict the overall team performance for both the Men and Women’s races at four recent NCAA D1 Cross Country Championship Meets, each of which experienced vastly different weather conditions: Rain, Snow, Sun, and Wind. 
The following table is included to help provide additional context to the variables related to each weather condition investigated and the location and year of each race.

<table class = "center">
	<tr>
		<th>Weather Condition</th>
		<th>Year</th>
		<th>Location</th>

The visualizations themselves have been created similar to those that investigated the effect of altitude on team performance. 
Each team is plotted on a map of the United States according to its school’s geographic location. 
The teams are represented by square boxes located at their respective latitude and longitudinal coordinates. 
Moreover, the boxes are shaded along a continuous color change from green to red according to how well a team placed at the Championship Meet in that specific year and weather condition compared to what the team was ranked the week prior to the meet. 
A legend is included on the right to describe this and provide insight that greener boxes represent a positive change in placement, meaning that the team performed better than they were ranked. 
While redder represent a negative change in placement, meaning that the team performed worse than they were ranked. 
As such, a more yellow color simply notes the team performed relatively equal to their initial ranking.
This diverging color encoding between green and red was included to help viewers easily understand positive (green) and negative (red) changes in a specific weather scenario. 
Additionally, this visualization offers tooltip functionality that displays a text box when a square data point is hovered over. 
Within this box is the name of the school, their placement at the Championship Meet, their ranking the week prior, and the year of the race. 
This was included to provide viewers with another method to compare how a team competed in a specific weather condition rather than just relying on the diverging color encoding. 
Also, this allowed for the name of each school to be noted, as not all viewers will know the geographic location of NCAA institutions. 
Finally, the visual employs a slider to allow viewers to compare different team performances across the various weather conditions analyzed.

It should be noted that at this current time, these visuals are only rough drafts of the final versions. 
Presently, they are beneficial at providing initial observations into the data and are formatted to at least address the specific points of interest in this study; 
however, additional edits and changes are planned to fully enable them to provide high level observations and expertly answer the specific interest points of this study. 
Some current ideas as to how to bolster the weather dependent visuals are
<br>
The following are some current ideas as to how to bolster the weather dependent visuals:
<br>
Employing a button/dropdown tool rather than a slider to change the weather visual being displayed. 
This would be changed because the slider is better suited for representing a continuous variable and the discrete nature of the four specific weather conditions would be better suited for a button/dropdown menu.
<br>
Starting the visuals at the “Sun” weather condition to provide a general basis in good weather conditions before displaying harsher weather.
<br>
Inclusion of a text box under the legend that can display the race year, location, temperature, wind speed, and cloud cover associated with each of the four investigated weather conditions. 
This would allow the viewers better insight into the specifics of the weather, not just a simple one-word description.
