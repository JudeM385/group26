<h1>An Exploration into the Electricity Consumption and Occupancy (ECO) Data Set</h1>

<h2>Dataset Description</h2>
<p>
The provided ECO data set provided electricity consumption data for three households in Switzerland.
The timespan of the data collection was over approximately an eight-month period from the end of July in 2012 to the end of January in 2013.
This data was gathered through the use of smart meters in these homes and includes measurements on current, voltage, and phase shift for each of the three phases in the household.
Additionally, plug-level data measuring the consumption of specific appliances was also provided.
The data was contained in a multitude of CSV files, with each file containing aggregate consumption data of a single day.
Each file then contains 86,400 rows, with each of these rows representing one second in the day.
</p>

<h2>Data Science Questions Posed</h2>
<p>
1.) Are there any noticeable differences between each households average daily energy usage?
<br>
<br>
2.) Do the households consume more energy in the winter compared to the summer?
</p>

<h2>Data Munging Process</h2>
<p>
Because of the vast amount of data provided, multiple aggregation steps were conducted to allow for easier visualization and answering of the proposed data science questions.
Firstly, subsetted datasets for each home were created that contained the average daily energy consumption per second for each day covered. 
These datasets were then combined, with the observation for each specific household being noted, and saved for later visualization.
Additionally, another dataset for each home that contained the average weekly energy consumption per second for each day covered was created from this daily data.
Similar to the daily datasets, these weekly datasets were then combined, with the observation for each specific household again being noted, and saved for later visualization.
</p>

<h2>Interactive Visualizations</h2>
<h3>Plotly Visualization</h3>
<p>The following Plotly Visualization was created to provide a compelling answer to the first data science question:</p>
<p>Are there any noticeable differences between each households average daily energy usage?</p>

The first data science question was asked because of the unique lens provided by the inclusion of multiple different household’s electricity consumption in the data.
Specifically, no one person, or family, lives the same lifestyle. 
As such, with the increasing reliance on technology, and thus electricity, to achieve even the simplest of tasks, the data offered a peek into how different households consume their electricity.
Thus, this visual sought to provide viewers with an overarching exploration of various factors related to each household’s average daily electricity usage.
<br>
<br>
To accomplish this goal, a visual employing a boxplot specific for each household was determined as the optimal visual.
This boxplot visual was constructed with a sideways orientation to allow viewers ease of top-down comparison between each household.
Though seemingly simple, a boxplot is quite powerful in providing viewers with multiple summary statistics (to include the median, the IQR, and outliers) about the data in an easily interpretable manner. 
Moreover, this specific boxplot visual also included an encoding denoting the mean daily electricity usage value for each household.
Additionally, the boxplot visuals are accompanied by the data points used to create the boxplot underneath them. 
This permits viewers a more detailed look into the actual distribution of the data points and allows for even more observations to be made across each household’s energy consumption.
It should also be noted that this visual displays the natural logarithm of average daily energy usage (as noted in the x-axis). 
This specific data normalization was conducted to allow for easier observation and comparison of each household’s boxplots and data points. 
Without this normalization the boxplots for household 4 and 6 were compressed and barely legible due to the drastic data distribution difference of household 5.
Furthermore, with the use of plotly these boxplot visuals and associated jittered points do not simply display the boxplot and points for each household and ask the viewer to interpret key statistics on their own. 
Rather, through the use of interaction encodings, summary statistic labels and values for a household are displayed to viewers when they choose to hover their mouse over any portion of the boxplot, 
and the value of individual points is displayed when hovered over as well.
This allows viewers to engage and explore the data to a much greater degree than a simple static boxplot visual.
<br>
<br>
In summary, this visual enables viewers to take a much deeper dive into the summary statistics and distribution of the daily average energy consumption across each household. 
As such, viewers are able to determine that there does seem to be noticeable differences between each household’s average daily energy usage. 
Then, with this new discovery, even more questions and hypothesis are formulated.
</p>


<h3>Altair Visualisation</h3>
<p>The following Altair Visualization was created to provide a compelling answer to the second data science question:</p>
<p>Do the households consume more energy in the winter compared to the summer?</p>

<p>
After exploring the visual that provided an answer for the first data science question, a new data science question was formulated. 
In the first visual it was observed that the data for household number five was not distributed like that of the other two households: with two major groupings of data points at each end of the IQR.
Thus, the second data science question was asked as it could provide more insight into this drastic difference data distribution in comparison to the other households.
<br>
<br>
To find and answer to this new question a visual that employed line charts for each household on a single axis across the additional dimension of time was created. 
Firstly, in an effort to maintain consistency and ease of interpretability, this new visual utilized the same colors to label each of the three households being investigated.
However, one major difference between this visual and that of the first is that this new visual observed a new unit of time. 
The first visual observed the average electricity consumption per day, but this second visual now displayed the average electricity consumption per week for each household.
This additional aggregation step was employed because it lowered the number of data points and axis labels, 
and thus minimized the clutter on the chart and allowed for a much greater ease in comparing data points across the various months and seasons specific to the question posed.
The visual was created with the module altair and thus also included several interactive effects.
To again provide viewers with the opportunity to explore the visual for themselves and gain additional insights into the data a mouse hover functionality was encoded.
Viewers are able to hover their mouse over a data point and the date and average energy expenditure values that data point represents appear.
Moreover, to help viewers know the respective household of that data point, when a data point is hovered over the entire line for that household is highlighted.
This can help viewers associate the household to each point in cluttered areas such as the far left of the visual.
<br>
<br>
Not only does this visual offer engaging and beneficial interaction techniques, but it also is powerful in describing the change in average energy usage across different months and seasons.
As can be observed, each of the three households maintain a relatively low weekly average energy expenditure in the months of July through September (summer months).
However, in October household five begins to see a drastic increase in its weekly average energy expenditure.
Moreover, this rise continues into November and then stays noticeably higher than the other two households throughout the rest of the data collection period (to the end of January).
Additionally, it can be seen that household four also experiences a slight increase in the weekly average energy expenditure in the winter months.
Sadly, a large portion of the data for household six was missing during the winter months and no reasonable conclusions can be made regarding that household.
Even so, this visual does provide ample opportunity for viewers to recognize the drastic difference in average energy consumption for household five, and even a slight increase for household four, in the winter months.
In summary, this visual provides an interactive and engaging experience for viewers to help viewers determine an answer to the data science question posed.
